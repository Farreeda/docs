# Formatting Code
Code formatting is powered by [JuliaFormatter.jl](https://github.com/domluna/JuliaFormatter.jl). Both the `Format Document` command (`Ctrl-Shift-I`) and `Format Selection` (`Ctrl-K Ctrl-F`) are supported.

The default formatting is fairly conservative and unintrusive, but you can customise it with a `.JuliaFormatter.toml` in your workspace. Check out the [relevant documentation here](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/stable/). **Note:** the configuration file _must_ be in the root directory opened in VSCode. This differs from the [standard search rules for JuliaFormatter.jl](https://domluna.github.io/JuliaFormatter.jl/stable/config/#Configuration-File).

Formatting helps to keep code readable by automatically aligning indentations and spaces.

The Julia formatter can automatically make this code:
```julia
f(x)=2x+3
print(f'( 2 ))

open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
	write(io, "Hello world!")
    end;
```

look like this:
```julia
f(x) = 2x + 3
print(f'(2))

open("myfile.txt", "w") do io
	write(io, "Hello world!")
end;
```

It's the very same code, though now it's much easier to read.

In order to format your code press `shift + cmd|windows + p` to bring up the command palette and search for `Format Document`
